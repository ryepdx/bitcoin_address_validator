bitcoin_address_validator
=========================

A small Python module that provides a function for validating Bitcoin addresses.
Most of the code is Gavin Andreson's work, copied from this forum post:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1026.20

Hopefully the very little bit of work I did removing it from its original
context as a Django form field class will save you some time in your own
endeavors.
